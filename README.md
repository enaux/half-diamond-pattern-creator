# Half-Diamond Pattern Generator

### Project Description

This is a simple Python program that generates half-diamond patterns.

The user can choose to create as many patterns as they wish, and they can choose the size of each pattern generated by the program.

The first pattern is generated automatically to provide an example of how the program works.
### Installation

Please ensure you have the latest version of Python installed.  
Download the pattern_generator.py file from this repository.  
You can then run the Python file directly or via your IDE.
### Usage Information

Upon starting the program, the first half-diamond pattern will be auto-generated.

The user is then presented with the option to create as many more patterns as they wish, until they choose to exit the program.

The patterns subsequently generated can be of any size - this is chosen by the user each time.

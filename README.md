# Half-Diamond Pattern Creator

This is a Python program that generates half-diamond patterns.

I have built it as part of a Skills Bootcamp undertaken with HyperionDev (CoGrammar).

After showing the user an example of the pattern, it offers the choice of creating further patterns of differing sizes - the user can choose.




## ðŸš€ About Me

I'm an aspiring software engineer getting stuck into learning Python and applying my knowledge through the projects that can be viewed on my Github profile.

I am also learning web development through certifications offered by freeCodeCamp. I hope you enjoy some of the webpages I have designed.
